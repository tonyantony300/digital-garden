AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications ‚Äì whether an existing application or a new SaaS-based application. You can use the AWS Management Console or well-documented web services APIs to access AWS‚Äôs application hosting platform.

AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need. With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.

You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments.

Account level services are not included. IAM, Billing, API Gateway sits in front of VPC etc etc.

And all these happen inside one Region. If you want to do the same in another region use some Iaac service ie terraform like.

Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon‚Äôs massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.

| EC2                   | Amazon Virtual Servers                            | Host the bits of things you think of as a computer.                                                                                                                                                                                            | It's handwavy, but EC2 instances are similar to the virtual private servers you'd get at Linode, DigitalOcean or Rackspace. |
| IAM                   | Users, Keys and Certs                             | Set up additional users, set up new AWS Keys and policies.                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                             |
| S3                    | Amazon Unlimited FTP Server                       | Store images and other assets for websites. Keep backups and share files between services. Host static websites. Also, many of the other AWS services write and read from S3.                                                                  |                                                                                                                             |
| VPC                   | Amazon Virtual Colocated Rack                     | Overcome objections that "all our stuff is on the internet!" by adding an additional layer of security. Makes it appear as if all of your AWS services are on the same little network instead of being small pieces in a much bigger network.  | If you're familar with networking: VLANs                                                                                    |
| Lambda                | AWS App Scripts                                   | Run little self contained snippets of JS, Java or Python to do discrete tasks. Sort of a combination of a queue and execution in one. Used for storing and then executing changes to your AWS setup or responding to events in S3 or DynamoDB. |                                                                                                                             |
| API Gateway           | API Proxy                                         | Proxy your apps API through this so you can throttle bad client traffic, test new versions, and present methods more cleanly.                                                                                                                  | 3Scale                                                                                                                      |
