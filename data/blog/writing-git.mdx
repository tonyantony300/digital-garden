Once a developer commit code to git repository, and pushed it to the remote, It is relatively hard to mess things up. Same amount or more difficulty involved when interacting with git also. It is so by design I believe. Every commits are tracked, recorded, retractable, tagged and all these happens in layered manner ie stage, commit and push.

Here is a neat flow-chart of how to to get out of a mess in git if you made one.
