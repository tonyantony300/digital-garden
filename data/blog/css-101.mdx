Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed. HTML provides the structure, whereas CSS specified the documentâ€™s style, including layout, color, font and positioning.
The browser loads the HTML, and converts it into a DOM (Document Object Model).The browser then fetches the resources linked within the HTML document, such as embedded images, video and CSS style sheets. From there, the browser parses the CSS to determine which rules should applied, and then attaches style to them as required. Once those decisions have been made, the structure the page should appear in after all rules have been applied is laid out in what is called a render tree. The render tree is the final blueprint, and once it is complete, the visual display of the page is show on the screen.
