I'm tony – your friendly neighborhood tech aficionado. My journey in the digital realm kicked off as a React Web Developer back in 2022. Armed with determination and a Udemy course on "Modern React with Redux," I dove into the world of web development. Git and VS Code became my partners in crime as I spun up more React projects than I can count – each a stepping stone in my learning adventure.

Fast forward to August 2022, and I find myself donning the hat of a Full-Stack Developer at Vualapp. Picture this: collaborating with a dynamic founding duo, automating invoice processes, and immersing myself in the art of Vue.js for that frontend finesse. AWS Lambda became my trusted sidekick, enabling me to build event-driven microservices that scream scalability. And the icing on the cake? Navigating a seamless product migration between AWS accounts – documentation and all.

But before the coding escapades, I had a stint as a Technical Service Engineer at SIBCA Electronics Equipment. From 2019 to 2021, I was the go-to person for all things related to Extra Low Voltage and Central Battery systems. Think of me as the tech handyman – programming, troubleshooting, and even nailing client communication. With every role I've embraced, my passion for tech has only grown stronger. Buckle up as I continue riding the tech wave, eager to explore the next frontier of innovation.
